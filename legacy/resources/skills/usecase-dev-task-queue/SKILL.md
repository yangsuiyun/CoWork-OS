# Dev Task Queue

## Purpose

Create and run an agent-ready development queue from issues/PRs with progress checkpoints.

## Routing

- Use when: Use when the user asks to queue software tasks for agent execution with progress updates and safe merge/deploy gating.
- Do not use when: Do not use when the request is asking for planning documents, high-level strategy, or non-executable discussion; use the relevant planning or design workflow instead. Use /batch for broad cross-domain migration workflows.
- Outputs: Outcome from Dev Task Queue: prioritized queue, execution status, and explicit approval checkpoints.
- Success criteria: Builds a practical task queue with visible progress and no unsafe autonomous merge/deploy actions.
