## Failure Triage

When a user reports a failure, error, or unexpected behavior that likely involves runtime/app behavior:

1. Check development logs first, if available.
2. Read `logs/dev-latest.log` for the most recent captured human-readable run, or `logs/dev-latest.jsonl` when structured fields help.
3. If `logs/dev-latest.log` / `logs/dev-latest.jsonl` are missing or stale for the current repro, run `npm run dev:log` to capture a fresh run.
4. If needed, inspect the newest timestamped `logs/dev-*.log` / `logs/dev-*.jsonl` pair for full context.
5. Quote relevant error lines with timestamps when summarizing findings.
6. If logs are missing, state that clearly and continue with other diagnostics.
7. If the request is not failure/debug related (for example docs, refactors, or feature questions), skip log triage unless the user explicitly asks for log analysis.
8. For Browser Use permission failures, also verify workspace permission rules: domain-scoped rules may now target a specific tool name or a tool-prefix (for example `browser_*`), and missing matches can cause repeated approval prompts or denials.

## Dev Log Availability

- Log capture is controlled by **Settings -> Appearance -> Developer logging** (default off).
- A forced capture run can be started with `npm run dev:log`.
- Captured runs write redacted text logs, structured JSONL logs, latest-run mirrors, and a `logs/dev-runs.json` manifest.
- Default cleanup keeps the last 14 days, always keeps the newest 20 runs, and caps retained `dev-*.log` / `dev-*.jsonl` files at 100 MB.
- Local cleanup overrides: `COWORK_DEV_LOG_RETENTION_DAYS`, `COWORK_DEV_LOG_MIN_RUNS`, and `COWORK_DEV_LOG_MAX_MB`.
- Optional local toggle state may exist at `.cowork/dev-log-settings.json`.

## Dev Startup Commands

- Use `npm run dev` for normal development startup; it routes through the log-aware wrapper.
- Use `npm run dev:start` only when you explicitly need the raw underlying startup command.
- `npm run dev:start` auto-selects an available localhost dev-server port (starting from `COWORK_DEV_SERVER_PORT`, default `5173`) and exports `COWORK_DEV_SERVER_URL` for Electron startup.
- `npm run dev:start` now checks Electron runtime readiness and, when the package exists but the binary is missing, runs `scripts/setup_native_driver.mjs` automatically before launching.
- If that repair still fails and logs report a missing Electron binary, run `npm run setup:native` (or `npm run setup`) and retry `npm run dev`.
- Use `npm run dev:log` to force timestamped capture to `logs/dev-*.log`, `logs/dev-*.jsonl`, `logs/dev-latest.log`, and `logs/dev-latest.jsonl`.
- Use `npm run dev:electron` (or the wrappers that call it) when starting Electron manually; it clears `ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE` to avoid renderer env pollution.
- Avoid using `npm run dev:react` alone for desktop debugging; it skips Electron preload APIs and can produce misleading behavior.

## Build Workflow

- `npm run build` now includes `npm run build:healthkit-bridge` before Electron/daemon/connectors builds.
- Use `npm run build:healthkit-bridge` to isolate HealthKit bridge build failures.
- Use `npm run build:react` to isolate renderer (Vite) build failures.
- Use `npm run build:electron` to isolate Electron TypeScript build failures.
- Use `npm run build:daemon` to isolate daemon TypeScript build failures.
- Use `npm run build:connectors` to isolate connector TypeScript build failures.
- `npm run build:healthkit-bridge` is a no-op on non-macOS platforms (`[healthkit-bridge] Skipping build on non-macOS platform.`).
- On macOS, `npm run build:healthkit-bridge` uses SwiftPM packaging by default; set `COWORK_HEALTHKIT_USE_XCODE_BUILD=1` (with a configured development team) to attempt an Xcode app build first, then fall back to SwiftPM if no app bundle is produced.
- For macOS signing/provisioning overrides during `build:healthkit-bridge`, use `COWORK_HEALTHKIT_DEVELOPMENT_TEAM` and `COWORK_HEALTHKIT_PROVISIONING_PROFILE` if needed.
- `build:healthkit-bridge` also accepts `DEVELOPMENT_TEAM` and `HEALTHKIT_BRIDGE_PROVISIONING_PROFILE` as fallback environment variable names.

## Packaging Workflow

- Use `npm run package` for standard local installer packaging after a full build.
- Use `npm run package:win:x64` to produce a Windows x64 installer build.
- `npm run package:win:x64` does not run the full workspace build; run `npm run build` first when renderer/electron/daemon/connectors outputs may be stale.
- `npm run package:win:x64` also runs `scripts/release-artifact-names.mjs` and `scripts/release-artifact-names.mjs --check` after packaging.
- Use `npm run package:linux:server` to produce a Linux server bundle (daemon/connectors plus launcher assets).
- `npm run package:linux:server` does not run renderer/electron builds; run `npm run build` first when desktop artifacts may be stale.
- `npm run package` also runs `scripts/release-artifact-names.mjs` and `scripts/release-artifact-names.mjs --check` to align and verify updater metadata artifact filenames in `release/`.
- On macOS distribution/signing flows, use `npm run package:mac`; it loads optional repo-root `.env.mac` (see `scripts/mac-notarize.env.example`), runs build + `electron-builder --mac --publish never`, aligns updater artifact names, and runs the macOS artifact smoke check.
- Use `npm run package:mac:unsigned` to force an unsigned macOS fallback build (sets `COWORK_MAC_UNSIGNED=1` and disables certificate auto-discovery).
- Unsigned macOS artifacts may require a manual **System Settings -> Privacy & Security -> Open Anyway** first-launch bypass on the target machine.
- `npm run package:mac` also respects `CSC_IDENTITY_AUTO_DISCOVERY=false`; when set, packaging uses unsigned macOS fallback settings (`identity: null`, notarization off, Gatekeeper assess off).
- For CI signing gate checks (before running `npm run package:mac`), use `node scripts/prepare_macos_signing_ci.mjs`; it validates Developer ID signing + notarization env inputs and can materialize `APPLE_API_KEY` from `APPLE_API_KEY_BASE64`/`APPLE_API_KEY_CONTENT`.
- Use `npm run package:desktop:smoke` for a cross-platform packaged desktop artifact smoke check.
- Use `npm run package:mac:smoke` or `npm run package:win:smoke` to isolate macOS/Windows packaged artifact smoke checks.
- Use `npm run package:linux:server:smoke` to validate the Linux server package output.
- Packaging icons are now sourced from `build/icon.png` (macOS) and `build/icon.ico` (Windows); update those files for release branding changes.
- Packaged builds now include skill asset folders via `resources/skills/**/assets/**`; place runtime skill media under each skill's `assets/` directory.

## NPM Release Workflow

- When asked to "publish a new release" or ship a new npm version, do **not** publish from a dirty working tree. Use a clean checkout or `git worktree`.
- Do **not** rely on `prepack`/`npm publish` lifecycle hooks for correctness. This repo's `.npmrc` sets `ignore-scripts=true`, so a naive `npm pack`/`npm publish` can skip the build and ship a broken package.
- `prepack` currently maps to `npm run build`, but with `ignore-scripts=true` it may not run during `npm pack`/`npm publish`; treat explicit `npm run build` as mandatory.
- Before any npm publish, explicitly run:
  - `npm ci --no-audit --no-fund`
  - `npm run build`
- After building, create the tarball explicitly with `npm pack --ignore-scripts --silent`.
- Verify the tarball contains the built desktop artifacts before publish. At minimum, it must contain:
  - `package/dist/electron/electron/main.js`
  - `package/dist/renderer/index.html`
- Validate the packed tarball in a clean temp project before publish:
  - install the tarball with `npm install --ignore-scripts --omit=optional --no-audit --no-fund <tarball>`
  - run `npm run --prefix node_modules/cowork-os setup`
  - fail if setup falls back into dependency bootstrap unexpectedly
  - verify Electron can load `better-sqlite3`
- Use `npm run release:smoke` for an end-to-end pre-publish check (`build` + tarball install/setup smoke validation).
- For release candidates that touch database schema or migrations, also test an upgrade-path database, not just a fresh install. Specifically verify startup/migration succeeds against an older DB shape representative of the reported issue.
- Publish from the clean built worktree with `npm publish --ignore-scripts` (plus `--otp=<code>` when npm 2FA requires it).
- After publish, verify registry propagation with:
  - `npm view cowork-os@<version> version`
  - `npm view cowork-os@<version> dist.tarball`
- When validating a Windows npm fix, prefer this recovery flow so old global installs do not interfere:
  - `taskkill /F /IM electron.exe /IM node.exe 2>nul`
  - `npm uninstall -g cowork-os`
  - remove `%APPDATA%\\npm\\node_modules\\cowork-os` and related `cowork-*.cmd` launchers if they still exist
  - `npm cache clean --force`
  - `npm install -g cowork-os@<version>`
- Do **not** advise users to delete their CoWork database/app-data directory for install or migration issues unless the user explicitly accepts data loss. Prefer shipping a migration fix.

## QA and Reliability Commands

- Use `npm run kit:lint` to run workspace kit health checks from the CLI (human-readable by default, JSON export supported by the CLI).
- `npm run kit:lint` runs `npm run build:electron` first, so expect an Electron TypeScript compile before lint output.
- Use `npm run kit:lint -- --json` for machine-readable kit health output.
- Use `npm run kit:lint -- --strict` to fail on warnings or missing tracked entries.
- Use `npm run skills:check` before test/merge when touching bundled skills; it runs routing/content/audit/eval quality gates.
- Use `npm run skills:check:core` for faster local iteration when you only need routing/content/audit checks (without routing eval).
- `npm run skills:check` supports staged strictness via `SKILLS_CHECK_PHASE=1|2|3` (`2` adds content path enforcement, `3` also enables strict warnings/eval enforcement).
- Emergency-only bypass exists for hotfix branches: set `SKILLS_CHECK_BYPASS=1` on `hotfix/*` to temporarily skip `skills:check`.
- Use targeted skill QA commands when isolating failures:
  - `npm run skills:validate-routing`
  - `npm run skills:validate-content`
  - `npm run skills:audit`
  - `npm run skills:eval-routing`
- Use `npm run qa:eval:build` to refresh the eval corpus when curating new reliability regressions.
- Use `npm run qa:eval:run` to replay the eval suite, and `npm run qa:reliability` for the combined eval + battery loop.
- Use `npm run qa:eval:enforce-regressions` to enforce production-fix-to-eval coverage policy.
- Use `npm run qa:security:harness` to run the security QA harness checks when validating security-sensitive behavior.
- Use `npm run qa:security:harness -- --fail-on-findings` when you need high/critical findings to fail CI or local verification runs.
- For confirmed security fixes, run `npm run qa:security:harness -- --confirmed-fix --fix-id <incident-or-pr-id> --fix-summary "Short fix summary"` to update `scripts/qa/eval-cases/security-harness-regressions.json`.
- Use `npx vitest run tests/tools/shell-tools.test.ts src/electron/agent/tools/__tests__/browser-tools.test.ts src/electron/security/__tests__/network-policy.test.ts` for a focused runtime-policy regression pass (shell tools + browser tools + network policy).
- Use `npm run qa:renderer-perf` to run the renderer performance fixture test (`src/renderer/utils/__tests__/renderer-perf-fixture.test.ts`) when validating virtualization/perf-sensitive renderer changes.
- Use `npm run qa:timeline:backfill -- --db /absolute/path/to.db` then `npm run qa:timeline:enforce -- --db /absolute/path/to.db` when validating timeline completion telemetry changes.
- `npm run test` and `npm run test:coverage` both run `npm run skills:check` before executing Vitest; use `npm run test:watch` for a faster local loop without the precheck gate.

## Code Quality Commands

- Use `npm run fmt` to apply Oxfmt formatting under `src/`.
- Use `npm run fmt:check` to validate formatting without writing changes.
- Use `npm run lint` for the default fast Oxlint pass.
- Use `npm run lint:eslint` only when you specifically need the ESLint pass.
- Use `npm run type-check` before merge when touching TypeScript-heavy paths.

## Setup Commands

- Use Node.js `>=24.0.0` to match the repo engine requirement before running setup/build/test commands.
- Use `npm run setup` for workstation setup; it chains native rebuild/install safeguards.
- `npm run setup` bootstraps dependencies with `npm install --ignore-scripts --no-audit --no-fund` when Electron is missing from local/parent `node_modules`.
- `npm run setup` retries `setup:native` when the native step is killed (SIGKILL/OOM style failures); tune retry count with `COWORK_SETUP_NATIVE_OUTER_ATTEMPTS` (default `6`).
- A successful `npm run setup` run attempts to install git hooks automatically; if that step fails, rerun `npm run hooks:install`.
- Use `npm run hooks:install` to (re)install local git hooks from `.githooks/` when setup hooks are missing or outdated.
- Use `npm run setup:native` to isolate native module/driver setup issues.
- Use `npm run setup:server` for server-only dependency/bootstrap flows (for example Linux VPS daemon/connectors).
- `npm run setup:server` runs `npm install` followed by `npm rebuild --ignore-scripts=false better-sqlite3` to ensure native SQLite bindings are rebuilt for the host.
- On macOS, `npm run dev:start` brands the local `node_modules/electron/dist/Electron.app` display name/icon as CoWork OS while preserving `CFBundleName=Electron` and `CFBundleIdentifier=com.github.Electron` for safeStorage compatibility.
- Set `COWORK_DEV_BRAND_APP=0` to skip dev Electron bundle branding.
- `scripts/codesign_electron_dev.mjs` is opt-in. Set `COWORK_CODESIGN_ENABLE=1` for ad-hoc development signing, or `COWORK_CODESIGN_IDENTITY` to pin an identity. `COWORK_CODESIGN_SKIP=1` still forces a skip.
