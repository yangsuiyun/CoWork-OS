# Project Status

## Production-Ready Implementation

CoWork OS is a **security-first personal AI assistant platform** with multi-channel messaging support, comprehensive guardrails, and extensive test coverage.

### What CoWork OS Is

- **Personal AI Gateway**: Connect your AI assistant to WhatsApp, Telegram, Discord, Slack, and iMessage
- **Everything Workbench**: Create, open, review, lightly edit, and revise generated documents, spreadsheets, presentations, web pages, PDFs, and previews from the same local-first task workspace
- **Managed Devices**: Operate local and remote CoWork machines from a dedicated Devices tab
- **Automations Surface**: One settings group for queueing, scheduling, triggers, briefing, and Workflow Intelligence suggestions/reflection/Dreaming; task view can also create cron scheduled tasks from the current task menu
- **Renderer Performance**: Sidebar and timeline virtualization in the `CoWork-OS/CoWork-OS` repo use `@chenglou/pretext` for text measurement and keep long task feeds responsive
- **Security-First Design**: 4,932 automated tests across 390 test files, configurable guardrails, layered permission rules, workspace-local policy files, and approval workflows
- **Imported Capability Security**: managed skill and pack imports are staged, scanned, reported, and quarantined when blocked instead of being activated directly
- **Multi-Provider Support**: 35 LLM provider options including free local models via Ollama, OpenRouter coding routers, and Grok through xAI API key or SuperGrok OAuth
- **Local-First Architecture**: Your data stays on your machine, BYOK model

## How It Works

### Execution Flow

```
1. User selects workspace folder
   |
2. User creates task with description
   |
3. AgentDaemon starts TaskExecutor
   |
4. TaskExecutor builds or refreshes SessionRuntime and delegates the next turn request to it
   |
5. SessionRuntime prepares the message set, owns the turn-loop mirror state, and constructs the active TurnKernel for the step, follow-up, or text turn
   |
6. For each plan step:
   - LLM decides which tools to use
   - TaskExecutor routes the batch through ToolScheduler and ToolRegistry
   - Tools perform operations (with permission checks)
   - Results sent back to LLM
   - Events logged and streamed to UI
   |
7. If approval needed:
   - TaskExecutor pauses
   - ApprovalDialog shown to user
   - User approves/denies
   - Execution continues or fails
   |
8. Task completes
   - Status updated to "completed"
   - All events and semantic completion summaries logged in database
   - Artifacts tracked
```

### Permission Model

```
Workspace Permissions:
├── Read: Enabled by default
├── Write: Enabled by default
├── Delete: Enabled, requires approval
├── Network: Enabled (for web search)
└── Shell: Requires approval

Operations Requiring Approval:
├── Delete file
├── Delete multiple files
├── Bulk rename (>10 files)
├── Shell command execution
└── External service calls
```

## What's NOT Implemented (Planned)

### Agent Integrity and Trap Defense
- **Status**: Planned
- **Spec**: `docs/agent-integrity-and-trap-defense-spec.md`
- **Why it matters**:
  - hardens CoWork OS against hidden-content prompt injection, semantic manipulation, poisoned memory, malicious delegation, and approval-fatigue attacks
  - turns current non-blocking prompt-injection detection into a durable runtime integrity model spanning ingestion, memory, permissions, delegation, and operator review
- **Planned phases**:
  - Phase 1: content integrity records and task-level risk classification for web, browser, scraping, email, and imported documents
  - Phase 2: trusted vs untrusted memory lanes and promotion gates for KG, playbooks, and skill proposals
  - Phase 3: provenance-aware approvals and permission decisions for sensitive actions
  - Phase 4: taint propagation and restrictions across agent teams, child tasks, and remote delegation
  - Phase 5: integrity dashboard plus eval and red-team coverage for agent-trap scenarios

### VM Sandbox
- **Status**: Stub implementation
- **File**: `src/electron/agent/sandbox/runner.ts`
- **What's needed**:
  - macOS Virtualization.framework integration
  - Linux VM image
  - Workspace mount
  - Network egress controls

### Sub-Agents / Multi-Agent Collaboration
- **Status**: Implemented (Collaborative Mode, `/multitask`, Multi-LLM Mode, Agent Comparison)
- **What's built**:
  - Collaborative Mode: ephemeral multi-agent teams with real-time thought sharing
  - `/multitask`: one-shot collaborative runs with bounded lane planning, lane-specific child tasks, queue-respecting dispatch, and synthesis
  - Multi-LLM Mode: same task dispatched to multiple providers with judge synthesis
  - Agent Comparison Mode: side-by-side output comparison across agents/models
  - Capability Matcher: auto-select agents based on task requirements
  - Git Worktree Isolation: per-task isolated branches with auto-commit/merge/cleanup

## Ready to Use

### You Can:
1. Select workspaces and create tasks
2. Use any configured LLM provider, including local Ollama and 30+ supported provider/gateway options
3. Execute multi-step file operations
4. Create real Office documents (.xlsx, .docx, .pdf, .pptx)
5. Search the web with multiple providers
6. Automate browser interactions
7. Run tasks remotely via WhatsApp, Telegram, Discord, or Slack
8. Track all agent activity in real-time
9. Approve/deny destructive operations
10. Receive automatic updates
11. Use Goal Mode with success criteria and auto-retry
12. Create custom skills with reusable workflows
13. Connect to MCP servers for extended tool access
14. Run multiple tasks in parallel (1-10 concurrent)
15. Configure safety guardrails (budgets, blocked commands)
16. Use system tools (screenshots, clipboard, open apps)
17. View artifacts with the in-app file viewer, including spreadsheet workbench views, document artifact editing, and rich `.pptx` deck previews
18. Customize agent personality via Settings or conversation prompts
19. Run tasks in isolated git worktrees with auto-commit and merge
20. Use collaborative mode for multi-agent team reasoning
21. Use `/multitask [N] <task>` for bounded parallel lane work
22. Use multi-LLM mode to compare outputs across providers
23. Compare agent outputs side by side
24. Pin tasks for quick access
25. Gracefully wrap up running tasks
26. Use git tools (commit, diff, branch) within tasks

### You Cannot (Yet):
1. Execute arbitrary code in a VM sandbox
2. Apply network egress controls

2. Electron window opens
3. DevTools open automatically
4. Workspace selector appears
5. Configure API credentials in Settings (gear icon)

## Performance Characteristics

### Token Usage (varies by provider)
- **Plan creation**: ~500-1000 tokens
- **Step execution**: ~1000-3000 tokens per step
- **Average task**: 5000-10000 tokens total

### Timing
- **Plan creation**: 2-5 seconds
- **Simple file operation**: 3-6 seconds per step
- **Document creation**: 5-10 seconds
- **Browser automation**: 2-10 seconds per action
- **Web search**: 1-3 seconds

### Resource Usage
- **Memory**: ~200-400MB (Electron + Playwright when active)
- **Database**: <1MB per task
- **CPU**: Minimal (except during API calls)

## Summary

**CoWork OS is a production-ready, security-first personal AI assistant platform:**

### Core Strengths
- **Security**: 4,932 automated tests across 390 test files, configurable guardrails, layered permission rules, approval workflows, and brute-force protection
- **Multi-Channel**: WhatsApp, Telegram, Discord, Slack, iMessage integration
- **Multi-Provider**: 35 LLM provider options and compatible gateways, including Claude, GPT, Gemini, Bedrock, OpenRouter Pareto Code routing, Ollama, and Grok through xAI API key or SuperGrok OAuth
- **Local-First**: Your data stays on your machine, BYOK model

- Multi-LLM Mode with judge-based synthesis
- Agent Comparison Mode for side-by-side output comparison
- Git Worktree Isolation for per-task branch isolation
- Task pinning and graceful wrap-up
- Personality customization (6 styles, 9 personas)
- Goal Mode with auto-retry
- Parallel task queue (1-10 concurrent)
- Remote access (Tailscale, SSH, WebSocket API)

### Planned
- Agent Integrity and Trap Defense runtime across ingestion, memory, approvals, and delegation
- VM sandbox using macOS Virtualization.framework
