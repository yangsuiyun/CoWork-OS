# Plugin Packs & Customize

Plugin packs are composable bundles that group skills, agent roles, connectors, and slash commands into a single installable unit. Most packs target a job function — engineering, sales, product management, legal practice areas — while workflow packs such as **CoWork Shortcuts** add reusable message-box shortcuts. Packs can optionally link to a [Digital Twin Persona](digital-twins.md) as an optional role preset.

Access from **Settings** > **Customize**.

## Concepts

### Plugin Pack

A JSON manifest (`cowork.plugin.json`) that bundles related capabilities:

| Field | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| **Skills** | Prompt templates with parameter substitution for specific workflows |
| **Skill Directories** | Directory-backed skills that load `SKILL.md` plus relative references, scripts, assets, and agent config from the pack |
| **Agent Roles** | Pre-configured agent identities with system prompts and capabilities |
| **Slash Commands** | Shortcut mappings that trigger skills via `/command` syntax in the message box |
| **Connectors** | Declarative tool definitions (HTTP, shell, script) for external services |
| **Try Asking** | Natural language prompt suggestions for discoverability |
| **Digital Twin Link** | Optional `personaTemplateId` connecting the pack to a proactive persona |
| **Best-Fit Workflows** | Optional `bestFitWorkflows` array tagging the pack to one or more operational lanes (`support_ops`, `it_ops`, `sales_ops`) |
| **Outcome Examples** | Optional `outcomeExamples` array of short strings describing what users achieve with the pack |

### Pack Scopes

| Scope | Source | Managed By |
|-------|--------|------------|
| **Bundled** | Ships with CoWork OS in `resources/plugin-packs/` | CoWork OS team |
| **Personal** | User-created in `~/.cowork/extensions/` | Individual user |
| **Organization** | Distributed by org admins | Organization admin |

### How Packs Differ from Individual Skills

Individual skills are standalone prompt templates. A pack is a **curated collection** that provides:

- Multiple related skills that work together
- A dedicated agent role with a tailored system prompt
- Recommended external connectors (MCP servers)
- Discoverable prompt suggestions via "Try asking"
- Optional digital twin integration for proactive automation

### Slash Commands and Message Box Shortcuts

Pack `slashCommands` are skill aliases. They map a visible command token to a target `skillId`:

```json
{
  "name": "gmail-summary-drive",
  "description": "Triage email and save a dated summary",
  "skillId": "gmail-summary-drive"
}
```

These aliases appear in the main message box `/` picker alongside deterministic app commands such as `/schedule`, `/clear`, and `/multitask`. Selection and manual typing both route through the existing skills runtime:

- aliases resolve to their mapped `skillId`
- pack and per-skill enable/disable state controls availability
- selecting a skill-backed alias inserts the slash token so the user can add context before sending
- alias collisions are resolved the same way in the picker and backend: enabled plugin aliases win over direct skill IDs

See [Message Box Shortcuts](message-box-shortcuts.md) for the full composer shortcut contract.

### Search & Filter

The search bar at the top of the sidebar filters packs in real time. It matches against pack name, display name, description, category, and skill names — so typing "deploy" surfaces the DevOps pack even if the word only appears in a skill description. Clear the search field to show all packs again.

### Sidebar

The left sidebar contains:

1. **Search bar** — Real-time filtering across all pack metadata
2. **Connectors** — Quick link to MCP connector settings
3. **Skills** — Quick link to the Skill Hub
4. **Packs** — All discovered plugin packs, grouped by scope (Personal, Organization, Bundled)

Packs with available updates show an orange dot indicator next to their name.

Click any pack to view its details in the right panel.

### Detail Panel

When a pack is selected, the right panel shows:

**Header**
- Pack name and description
- Toggle switch to enable/disable the pack (state persists across restarts)
- Digital Twin badge (if the pack links to a persona template)
- Recommended connectors chips (clickable — navigates to connector settings)
- Update available badge (shown when a newer version exists in the registry)

**Tabs**

| Tab | Content |
|-----|---------|
| **Commands** | Card grid of slash commands derived from skills. Each card shows the `/command-name` and description. |
| **Skills** | List of all skills in the pack with icon, name, description, and **per-skill toggle switch**. Individual skills can be enabled or disabled independently without toggling the entire pack. |
| **Agents** | Agent roles defined by the pack, plus a Digital Twin entry if `personaTemplateId` is set. |

When `bestFitWorkflows` is set, the pack header shows colored **Best for** lane badges (Support Ops, IT Ops, Sales Ops). When `outcomeExamples` is set, a short bulleted list of outcomes appears below the badges.

**Try Asking**

A list of clickable natural language prompts. Clicking a prompt sends it to the chat as a new task — no need to figure out the exact command.

### "Try Asking" in Chat Empty State

When the chat input is empty (no active task), the main screen displays a selection of "Try asking" prompts drawn from all enabled plugin packs. Up to 5 prompts are randomly sampled from across your active packs, giving you one-click access to common workflows. Each chip shows which pack it came from on hover.

Clicking a prompt pre-fills the chat input and starts the task immediately.

### Context Panel

The Context Panel is a collapsible sidebar that shows what capabilities are currently active in your session:

- **Connectors** — Connected MCP servers with status indicators
- **Skills** — Enabled skills from active packs

It auto-refreshes every 30 seconds and provides at-a-glance awareness of your active tooling.

## Bundled Plugin Packs

CoWork OS ships with 37 plugin packs covering common job functions, finance workflows, legal workflows, security review, and reusable message-box shortcuts.

### CoWork Shortcuts

| | |
|---|---|
| **Icon** | ⚡ |
| **Category** | Productivity |
| **Agent Role** | None |

**Purpose:** seed message-box workflow shortcuts as regular skills, not hard-coded app actions.

**Core shortcuts:**
- `/strategy`
- `/review` - review local changes or a pull request from a regular workspace
- `/memory`

**File and workspace shortcuts:**
- `/batch-rename`
- `/smart-deduplication`
- `/folder-structure`
- `/archive-stale-files`
- `/template-generator`
- `/recursive-search-extract`
- `/format-converter`
- `/size-audit`

**Communication, calendar, and cross-source shortcuts:**
- `/gmail-summary-drive`
- `/calendar-prep-brief`
- `/slack-action-items`
- `/email-chain-resolver`
- `/meeting-notes-distributor`
- `/multi-source-report`
- `/weekly-newsletter`
- `/daily-inbox-zero`
- `/monday-planning-brief`
- `/end-of-day-log`

**Document and research shortcuts:**
- `/drive-analysis-slides`
- `/cross-platform-search`
- `/voice-note-draft`
- `/meeting-recording-notes`
- `/research-executive-brief`
- `/proposal-customizer`
- `/contract-plain-english`
- `/spreadsheet-narrative`

- `/weekly-file-cleanup`
- `/monthly-financial-organizer`
- `/competitive-scan`

See [Message Box Shortcuts](message-box-shortcuts.md#cowork-shortcuts-pack) for the complete current list and runtime behavior.

### Codex Security

| | |
|---|---|
| **Icon** | Shield |
| **Category** | Engineering |
| **Agent Role** | Security Reviewer |

**Purpose:** run repository, diff, and deep multi-pass security review workflows through the CoWork task runtime.

**Core skills and commands:**
- `/codex-security:security-scan` - repository-wide or scoped-path security scan
- `/codex-security:security-diff-scan` - security review of a Git diff
- `/codex-security:deep-security-scan` - deeper repository-wide scan with six independent discovery workers per round

The pack is directory-backed: it loads upstream-style `SKILL.md` workflows, shared `references/`, `scripts/`, `assets/`, and `agents/` from `resources/plugin-packs/codex-security/`. CoWork also exposes internal scan orchestration helpers only inside Codex Security scan tasks. Those helpers prepare worklists, create deep-scan worker directories, check worker artifacts, merge completed rounds, and render validated reports.

See [Codex Security Scans](codex-security-scans.md) for scan modes, artifact layout, workspace safety rules, and validation commands.

### Claude-for-Legal Packs

CoWork OS bundles the Claude-for-Legal practice packs from `resources/plugin-packs/*legal*/`. They expose upstream-style legal slash commands through the same plugin-pack alias system used by other packs.

Bundled legal packs include:

- AI Governance Legal
- Cocounsel Legal
- Commercial Legal
- Corporate Legal
- Employment Legal
- IP Legal
- Legal Builder Hub
- Legal Clinic
- Litigation Legal
- Privacy Legal
- Product Legal
- Regulatory Legal

Legal commands are picker-first and editable: selecting a command inserts the slash token and leaves the user in the composer so they can add matter context before sending. For example:

```text
/litigation-legal-demand-intake unpaid invoices acme logistics
```

Matter-heavy legal workflows can also surface a main-view intake card after the task starts. The demand-letter workflow gets a dedicated demand intake card; other legal workflows that benefit from structured context get a generic legal workflow details card. Operational management commands from Legal Builder Hub, such as disable/uninstall/update commands, skip matter-intake UI.

See [Claude-for-Legal Workflows](claude-for-legal.md) for examples, safety behavior, and focused test commands.

### State Persistence

Pack and skill toggle states are persisted in `pack-states.json` in the user data directory (`~/Library/Application Support/cowork-os/`). The file uses the following format:

```json
{
  "packs": {
    "engineering": true,
    "sales-crm": false,
    "devops": true
  },
  "skills": {
    "engineering": {
      "code-review-prep": true,
      "dependency-audit": false
    }
  }
}
```

- **Pack states**: `true` = enabled, `false` = disabled. Packs not listed default to enabled.
- **Skill states**: Nested by pack name, then skill ID. Skills not listed default to the pack's `enabled` value.
- States are loaded on app startup and applied during plugin registration.
- Deleting `pack-states.json` resets all toggles to their manifest defaults.

### Skill Conflict Detection

When multiple packs register a skill with the same ID, the registry logs a warning:

```
[PluginRegistry] Skill ID "code-review" already registered by plugin "engineering",
now being registered by "qa-testing". The later registration will take precedence.
```

This helps pack authors avoid accidental ID collisions. The later-registered skill wins, but both packs continue to load normally.

### Update Detection

The Customize panel checks for pack updates in the background on mount. It compares installed pack versions against the remote registry catalog using semver comparison. Packs with newer versions available show:
- An **orange dot** on the sidebar item
- An **"Update available: vX.Y.Z"** badge in the detail panel header

Update checks are non-blocking and fail silently if the registry is unavailable.

## Plugin Store

The Plugin Store is an in-app modal for discovering, installing, and creating plugin packs.

### Accessing the Store

Click the **"+"** button in the Customize panel sidebar header to open the Plugin Store.

### Features

**Browse Registry**
- Search packs by name or description with debounced filtering
- Filter by category using clickable chips
- Paginated results grid with pack cards showing icon, name, description, and category
- Click "Install" to install from the remote registry (via git URL or manifest download)
- Install results surface whether the pack was installed cleanly, installed with a warning, or quarantined

**Install from URL/Git**
- Enter any Git URL (`github:owner/repo`, `https://github.com/...`, `git@github.com:...`)
- Or enter a direct URL to a `cowork.plugin.json` manifest
- Progress feedback during installation
- Imported packs are scanned before activation and can be quarantined with a stored report instead of being loaded immediately

**Create New Pack**
- Fill in pack name, display name, category, and icon
- Scaffolds a new pack directory in `~/.cowork/extensions/`
- Includes example skill and agent role to get started
- Opens in the Customize panel immediately after creation

### How Installation Works

**From Git:**
1. Shallow clone the repository to a temp directory
2. Validate the `cowork.plugin.json` manifest
3. Run install-time bundle security scanning against the manifest, declarative connectors, bundled scripts, and any detected package references
4. Remove the `.git` directory
5. Move to `~/.cowork/extensions/{pack-name}/` only if the scan verdict allows activation
6. Trigger plugin discovery to register the new pack

**From URL:**
1. Fetch the manifest JSON from the URL
2. Validate required fields and structure
3. Stage the manifest and run install-time security scanning
4. Write to `~/.cowork/extensions/{pack-name}/cowork.plugin.json` only if the scan verdict allows activation
5. Trigger plugin discovery to register the new pack

If a pack is blocked, CoWork stores it in quarantine outside the normal discovery path and exposes:
- a short install result summary
- a detailed report view in the Customize panel
- retry scan and removal actions

**From Scaffold:**
1. Validate pack name (kebab-case, max 64 chars, no path traversal)
2. Create directory in `~/.cowork/extensions/`
3. Generate `cowork.plugin.json` with all fields populated
4. Optionally include example skill and agent role
5. Trigger plugin discovery to register the new pack

### Uninstallation

Only user-installed packs (in `~/.cowork/extensions/`) can be uninstalled. Bundled packs and organization packs cannot be removed.

To uninstall: right-click a personal pack in the sidebar or use the API:
```typescript
window.electronAPI.uninstallPluginPack("my-custom-pack")
```

## Imported Pack Security

Imported packs are treated as a trust boundary.

CoWork now applies the following behavior to packs installed from Git or URL sources:
- installs are staged before activation
- declarative connectors, manifest fields, bundled text/script content, and inferred package references are scanned before the pack is registered
- high-confidence malicious findings move the pack into quarantine instead of loading it
- warning-only findings still allow install, but the Customize panel shows a visible **Security Warning** badge and summary
- managed packs keep a persisted security report and bundle digest so CoWork can detect post-install changes and quarantine tampered imports on the next discovery pass
- unmanaged local pack folders are not auto-quarantined, but warning findings can still be surfaced in the Customize panel

---

## Remote Pack Registry

The remote pack registry enables discovering and installing community-contributed packs.

### How It Works

The registry follows the same architecture as the Skill Registry:

1. **Static catalog mode**: Fetches a `pack-catalog.json` file from a GitHub-hosted registry
2. **REST API fallback**: For non-GitHub registries, queries standard REST endpoints
3. **5-minute cache TTL**: Catalog responses are cached locally to reduce network requests

### Default Registry URL

```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CoWork-OS/CoWork-OS/main/registry
```

Override with the `PLUGIN_PACK_REGISTRY` environment variable.

### Catalog Format

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "updatedAt": "2025-01-15T00:00:00Z",
  "packs": [
    {
      "id": "my-pack",
      "name": "my-pack",
      "displayName": "My Pack",
      "description": "A community pack",
      "version": "1.0.0",
      "author": "Author Name",
      "icon": "🔧",
      "category": "Engineering",
      "tags": ["engineering", "devops"],
      "gitUrl": "https://github.com/author/my-pack",
      "downloadUrl": "https://example.com/my-pack.json",
      "skillCount": 3,
      "agentCount": 1
    }
  ]
}
```

---

## Admin Policies & Organization Scope

Enterprise administrators can control plugin pack availability across the organization. See [Admin Policies](admin-policies.md) for the full guide.

### Organization Plugin Packs

Packs placed in the organization directory are loaded with `scope: "organization"` and shown in a separate "Organization" section in the Customize sidebar.

**Default org directory:** `~/.cowork/org-plugins/`
**Custom org directory:** Set via Admin Policies > Organization > Organization Plugin Directory

### Policy Enforcement

| Policy | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| **Blocked packs** | Pack shows as disabled, cannot be toggled on |
| **Required packs** | Pack cannot be toggled off, auto-activated |
| **Allowed packs** | If set, only listed packs are permitted (whitelist) |
| **Blocked connectors** | Specific connectors cannot be used |
| **Installation controls** | Toggle custom pack creation, git install, URL install |

Policies are enforced at the IPC handler level — the UI reflects policy state with visual indicators (lock icons, disabled toggles).

---

## Creating a Custom Pack

There are three ways to create a custom pack:

### 1. Via Plugin Store (Recommended)

1. Open the Customize panel
2. Click the **"+"** button to open the Plugin Store
3. Switch to the "Create New" tab
4. Fill in pack name, display name, category, and icon
5. Click "Create Pack"

### 2. Manual Creation

Create a directory in `~/.cowork/extensions/` with a `cowork.plugin.json` manifest:

```
~/.cowork/extensions/my-custom-pack/
└── cowork.plugin.json
```

### 3. Via CLI API

```typescript
window.electronAPI.scaffoldPluginPack({
  name: "my-custom-pack",
  displayName: "My Custom Pack",
  category: "Engineering",
  icon: "🔧",
  author: "Your Name",
})
```

### Skill Prompt Tips

- Use `{{parameterName}}` for parameter substitution
- Structure prompts with numbered lists for consistent output format
- Include "Please provide:" sections to guide the LLM
- Keep prompts focused on one task per skill
- Add context fields for optional additional information

### Directory-Backed Skill Tips

- Use `skillDirectories` when a skill needs a full folder, such as `SKILL.md`, `references/`, `scripts/`, `assets/`, or `agents/`.
- `path` must be relative to the plugin pack root. Absolute paths and parent traversal are rejected.
- Each directory must contain `SKILL.md`.
- Display metadata resolves in this order: manifest field, `SKILL.md` frontmatter, generated title from skill ID.
- Per-skill enable/disable state is persisted for both inline `skills` and directory-backed `skillDirectories`.
- Packaged builds include `resources/plugin-packs/**`, so future non-reference files under a bundled pack are preserved.

### Linking a Digital Twin

Set `personaTemplateId` to any existing persona template ID (e.g., `"software-engineer"`, `"product-manager"`). The pack will show a Digital Twin badge in the Customize panel, and users can activate the linked persona from Mission Control.

See [Digital Twin Personas Guide](digital-twin-personas-guide.md) for the full list of available templates and their capabilities.

## Competitive Advantages

CoWork OS plugin packs offer capabilities beyond typical AI assistant plugins:

| Feature | CoWork OS | Typical AI Plugins |
|---------|-----------|-------------------|
| **Digital Twin integration** | Packs link to proactive personas that work in the background | Reactive only — waits for user prompts |
| **Multi-model** | Skills work with 35 LLM provider options (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Grok, local) | Locked to single provider |
| **Local-first** | All pack data on device, no cloud dependency | Cloud-dependent |
| **MCP standard** | Connectors use open Model Context Protocol | Proprietary integrations |
| **Heartbeat tasks** | Twins proactively surface insights on a schedule | No background processing |
| **Agent Teams** | Packs include team configurations for multi-agent orchestration | Single agent only |
| **Declarative** | Create packs with JSON only — no code required | Often requires code |

---

## Troubleshooting

### Pack not appearing in Customize panel
- Verify `cowork.plugin.json` exists in the pack directory
- Check that `"type": "pack"` is set in the manifest
- Ensure the `name` field is unique across all packs
- Restart the app to trigger pack discovery
- Check if the pack is blocked by admin policy (Settings > Admin Policies)

### Skills not executing
- Check that the pack is toggled ON (enabled)
- Verify skill parameters match the `{{placeholder}}` names in the prompt
- Check the `"enabled": true` flag on each skill

### Digital Twin badge not showing
- Confirm `personaTemplateId` is set in the manifest
- Verify the referenced template ID exists in `resources/persona-templates/`
- The badge appears in the Agents tab and the pack header

### Toggle doesn't persist after restart
- Pack enable/disable states are persisted in `pack-states.json` in the user data directory
- Per-skill toggle states are also persisted (individual skills within a pack can be toggled on/off)
- If states appear to reset, check that the user data directory is writable
- Delete `pack-states.json` to reset all toggles to defaults

### Pack toggle is locked / cannot be disabled
- The pack may be marked as **required** by admin policy
- Check Settings > Admin Policies > Required Packs
- Required packs show a lock indicator and cannot be toggled off

### Pack is blocked by policy
- The pack is in the admin policy blocked list
- Contact your organization admin to unblock it
- Blocked packs appear grayed out with a "Blocked" indicator

### Git install fails
- Verify the Git URL is accessible (try cloning manually)
- Check that the repo contains a valid `cowork.plugin.json` at the root
- Git-based installation may be disabled by admin policy

### Skill ID conflict between packs
- Two packs may define skills with the same ID
- The registry logs a warning at startup: check the console for `[PluginRegistry] Skill ID "..." already registered by`
- The later-loaded pack's skill takes precedence
- Fix by renaming the conflicting skill ID in one of the packs

### Update indicator not showing
- Update checks require the remote pack registry to be reachable
- Checks run in the background on panel mount and fail silently on network errors
- Only packs in the remote registry catalog can have update indicators
- Bundled packs are updated with app releases, not via the registry

### Search not finding a pack
- The search bar matches against: display name, name, description, category, and skill names
- Search is case-insensitive
- Try a broader term or clear the search to show all packs

### Plugin Store shows "Installation disabled"
- Admin policies may restrict custom pack creation or remote installation
- Check Settings > Admin Policies > Installation Permissions

### Pack installed but is not visible
- The import may have been quarantined during install or on the next discovery pass
- Open the Customize panel and check the **Quarantined Imports** section
- Use **View Report** to inspect the finding, then retry the scan or remove the pack
