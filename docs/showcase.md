# CoWork OS — Use Case Showcase

A comprehensive guide to what you can build, automate, and manage with CoWork OS. Each section includes the capabilities involved, example prompts, and which skills/connectors/packs power the workflow.

## AI Super App For Everyday Work

CoWork OS is positioned as a GUI-first local AI super app and everything app: one place for coding, email, research, web design, documents, spreadsheets, presentations, agent spawning and management, automations, channels, devices, and long-running work. The product is broader than an office artifact viewer; artifacts are one part of the larger agentic workspace.

Unlike CLI-first agent tools, CoWork makes many-agent work visible: users can create reusable agents in Agents Hub, spawn parallel lanes, watch delegated runs in task timelines, assign work through Mission Control, and manage teams from GUI surfaces built for normal daily operation.

---

## Everything Workbench For Knowledge Work

Inside that broader OS, the Everything Workbench makes generated knowledge-work outputs first-class. Instead of treating docs, sheets, decks, pages, and PDFs as disconnected files, CoWork shows them as task artifacts: open them in the right sidebar, expand them fullscreen, review or lightly edit them, and ask the agent for follow-up changes in the same context. See [Everything Workbench](everything-workbench.md).

This makes CoWork the default workspace instead of jumping between Word, Excel, PowerPoint, browser previews, Finder, mail, and chat for generated work. External app actions remain available when the task needs advanced native functionality.

## Software Engineering

### Code Generation & Scaffolding

Build entire features, modules, or applications from a natural language description. The agent reads your existing codebase, follows your project's conventions, and produces files that compile and pass lint on the first try.

**What it handles:**
- Full-stack feature scaffolding (API endpoints, database models, UI components, tests)
- Language-specific idioms — TypeScript, Python, Rust, Go, Swift, Kotlin, C#, C++, GDScript
- Framework scaffolding — React, Next.js, Express, FastAPI, Django, Rails, SwiftUI, Jetpack Compose
- Boilerplate reduction — generates repetitive code (CRUD operations, form validation, serializers) while you focus on business logic

**Example prompt:**
```
Create a REST API for a blog platform with posts, comments, and tags.
Use Express + TypeScript + Prisma + PostgreSQL.
Include input validation, pagination, and error handling.
Generate tests for each endpoint.
```

**Powered by:** Built-in coding agent, `run_command` tool, file tools, `write-tests` skill

---

### Code Review & Refactoring

Review pull requests, identify code smells, and refactor with confidence. The agent understands your codebase context — not just the diff.

**What it handles:**
- Structured PR review with risk assessment, missing test coverage, and approval recommendations
- TypeScript/JavaScript migration (e.g., JS → TS with full type annotations)
- Large-scale refactoring — rename symbols across files, extract shared modules, decompose monoliths
- SOLID principle enforcement, dead code removal, import cleanup

**Example prompt:**
```
Review the changes in PR #42. For each file, assess risk level (low/medium/high),
flag potential bugs, note missing tests, and give an overall approve/request-changes recommendation.
```

**Powered by:** `code-review` skill, `refactor-code` skill, `clean-imports` skill, Engineering plugin pack

---

### Debugging & Root Cause Analysis

Paste an error, a stack trace, or describe unexpected behavior — the agent traces through your code to find the root cause and suggests a fix.

**What it handles:**

- Race condition and concurrency debugging
- Memory leak investigation
- Performance regression diagnosis
- Environment-specific issues (works on my machine / doesn't work in CI)

**Example prompt:**
```
This test passes locally but fails in CI with "ECONNREFUSED 127.0.0.1:5432".
Here's the CI config and docker-compose.yml. Find the issue and fix it.
```

**Powered by:** `debug-error` skill, `run_command` tool, file analysis tools

---

### Test Generation & Coverage

Generate unit, integration, and end-to-end tests that cover edge cases you didn't think of. The agent reads your implementation and infers the test surface.

**What it handles:**
- Unit test generation (Jest, pytest, NUnit, XCTest, JUnit)
- Integration test scaffolding with mock setup
- Edge case discovery — boundary values, null inputs, concurrent access, error paths
- Coverage gap analysis — identifies untested functions and branches
- Test data factories and fixture generation

**Example prompt:**
```
Write comprehensive tests for the PaymentService class.
Cover happy paths, insufficient funds, expired cards, network timeouts,
idempotency, and concurrent payment attempts.
Use Jest with TypeScript.
```
